AI Chatbot Project

This is a project constructed under non-Microsoft environment and would relatively low-cost for mid to small size enterprize implementation.

Key Concepts:
- RAG: code for converting original files into LLM-friendly format
- Prompt Engineering: commonly used prompt for different purposes
- Flask API: light server construction code
- Frontend chat-UI design with user verification system: sample basic html code for chat interface
- Open source deployment with Heroku 

Scenarios for adapting this idea:
- limited resources and budget for a thorough and integrated eco-system for constructing AI Chatbot
- adjusted answer based on your knowledge database, not un-modified answer from original LLM model
