Brainstorming and Learning Notes by Author

This note listed down all the design process and author's chain of thought. All solutions and suggestions were given by ChatGPT.

- Design Q1: if I put all verification information in app.py, would it successfully trigger ID verifying process before using AI Chatbot services?
- ChatGPT A1: 
    (1) use "session" for verification function
    (2) redirect to mainpage after successfully verified
    (3) logout after using the service

2025.3.1(Saturday)
- Key change in code:
    (1) all inputs and responses must be converted into vector information and retrieved from txt
    (2) limited token quota for LLM search
    (3) fetch api/chat method 'POST' versus 'GET': determines how secured the service is

2025.3.2(Sunday)
- Heroku deployment failed:
    (1) Tips for using Heroku
      (1)-1 Slug size: Maximum 500MB for all uploaded files, including dependencies and libraries. Ensure taht the slug size remains below 500MB to avoid deployment failures  
      (1)-2 files must include: 
         -- Procfile (e.g. web:gunicorn app:app):
            - Ensure the filename is "Procfile" with no file extension
            - The format is: 'web: <command>' (e.g., 'web:gunicorn app:app)
         -- .gitignore (must exclude large and unnecessary files)
            - venv/
            - __pycache__/
            - .env
            - *.pyc
            - *.pkl
            - *.sqlite3
         -- Requirements.txt: Be careful with large dependencies (e.g., SentenceTransformers, faiss-cpu)
            - Instead of installing all sentence-transformers models, use:
               `from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer`
               `model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')`
         -- API key setting: Run the following command in the terminal:
              heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
            - Then use `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")` in Python
         -- Do not use "runtime.txt", replace with ".python-version"
    (2) Reinitializing Heroku apps:
      (2)-1 Must del all git history
      (2)-2 Modify all files, then run:
           git add .
           git commit -m "..." "
      (2)-3 Push to Heroku:
           git push heroku main # (or master)
