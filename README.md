## Taiwan Labor Law Chatbot (RAG vs Fine-tuned)

This project implements and evaluates two backend architectures for a chatbot designed to answer questions related to Taiwan's Labor Standards Act:

* A fine-tuned RoBERTa model for legal clause classification
* A GPT-4 + FAISS-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system

Both models are compared in terms of accuracy, response reliability, and production-readiness.

### üîç Why this project matters

Many employees and recruiters struggle to interpret Taiwan's labor laws. This project demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can reduce barriers to legal knowledge by combining classification and retrieval techniques to provide accurate, accessible answers.

By fine-tuning BERT on categorized legal clauses and comparing it with RAG-style retrieval, this chatbot offers a low-resource solution for improving legal literacy and fairness in the workplace.

### üìÑ System Overview

* **User Input** ‚Üí Inference pipeline
* **Option 1:** RoBERTa classifier (5 legal categories) ‚Üí Predefined response
* **Option 2:** GPT-4 + FAISS vector search ‚Üí Top-1 semantic match + GPT response
* CLI-based demo provided for both architectures

### üß™ Model Comparison

| Model               | Accuracy |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Fine-tuned RoBERTa  | 90%      |
| GPT-4 + FAISS (RAG) | 18%      |

**Insights:**

* Fine-tuned models show high consistency and precision for domain-specific classification tasks
* RAG pipelines underperform in legal QA due to ambiguous phrasing and semantic similarity limitations

---

### üîß Key Features

* Binary evaluation (correct/incorrect) on 50 manually labeled test questions
* Confidence score output for RoBERTa predictions
* Keyword-boosted FAISS retrieval for edge-case handling
* Modular architecture for easy extension to other legal domains

---

### üîÑ Suggested Deployment Architecture

* Use fine-tuned BERT (or RoBERTa) as the **routing classifier**
* Use GPT (e.g. GPT-4) for **response generation** after classification
* Explore multi-task learning (classification + generation) in future iterations
